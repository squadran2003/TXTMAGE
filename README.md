# TXTMAGE

This project is me experimenting with Open AI Dalle3 API.

## Overview

TXTMAGE is a text-based AI system that utilizes the power of the OpenAI API Dalle3  to generate images based on a text prompt.


## Getting Started

To get started with TXTMAGE, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/TXTMAGE.git`
2. create an .env file in root directory with the following variables
    ```
        DB_NAME=
        DB_USERNAME
        DB_PASSWORD
        DB_HOSTNAME
        DB_PORT
        SECRET_KEY
        DEBUG
        ALLOWED_HOSTS
        POSTGRES_USER
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD
        POSTGRES_DB
        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
        OPENAPI_KEY
    ```
3. docker-compose up --build

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with TXTMAGE by sending text inputs through the provided interface. The system will generate responses based on the input and provide them in real-time.
